feat: Add master deployment controller with profile support and docker-compose integration

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Stage 6 now uses docker-compose instead of individual docker build commands
- Stage 7 test script health check updated to match API response format

NEW FEATURES:
Master Deployment Controller (deploy-master-controller.py)
- 11-stage automated deployment pipeline (0-10)
- Interactive and automated modes (--mode interactive/auto)
- Local and cloud deployment targets (--target local/cloud)
- 3 deployment profiles: quick, full, cloud (--profile)
- Checkpoint system for resume capability (--resume)
- Force re-run stages (--force)
- Skip optional stages (--skip-toxicity, --skip-ui)
- Real-time output streaming for all long-running stages
- Comprehensive logging and progress tracking
- Deployment metrics and reporting

Deployment Profiles:
- Quick: 1 epoch, 64 seq length, 1-2 min GPU (80-85% acc)
- Full: 15 epochs, 256 seq length, 15-25 min GPU (90-93% acc)
- Cloud: 10 epochs, 256 seq length, FP16, GCP optimized (90-93% acc)

Docker Compose Integration:
- Stage 6 now uses docker-compose for parallel builds
- Builds both API and UI images simultaneously
- Switched to lightweight UI (Dockerfile.streamlit.api)
- Reduced UI image size from 29.5GB to ~1-2GB (15x smaller)
- Build time reduced from 20+ min to 43 sec (cached)

IMPROVEMENTS:
Configuration Updates:
- Created config/config_transformer_quick.yaml (quick profile)
- Fixed config structure to match transformer_training.py expectations
- Added deployment profile documentation

Test Script Fixes:
- Fixed test-fullstack-local.ps1 health check (match ok instead of healthy)
- Proper status code validation (200 OK)

Docker Optimizations:
- Updated .dockerignore to exclude .deployment/ directory
- Reduced build context from 8.31GB to 538MB (15x reduction)
- Faster builds with better layer caching

Output Streaming:
- Enabled real-time output for all stages (0-10)
- Stage 0: pip install, requirements
- Stage 1-4: Training (preprocessing, baselines, transformer, toxicity)
- Stage 6: Docker compose build
- Stage 7: pytest and PowerShell tests
- Stage 8: GCS uploads
- Stage 9-10: GCP deployment scripts

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
Files Modified:
- deploy-master-controller.py (1,987 lines) - Main orchestration script
- config/config_transformer_quick.yaml - Quick training profile
- scripts/test-fullstack-local.ps1 - Fixed health check logic
- .dockerignore - Added deployment artifacts exclusion
- docker-compose.fullstack.yml - Used for Stage 6 builds

Stages Implemented:
- Stage 0: Environment Setup (venv, pip, requirements)
- Stage 1: Data Preprocessing
- Stage 2: Baseline Training (Logistic Regression, Linear SVM)
- Stage 3: Transformer Training (DistilBERT with profile support)
- Stage 4: Toxicity Training (multi-head model)
- Stage 5: Local API Testing
- Stage 6: Docker Build (docker-compose)
- Stage 7: Full Stack Testing (pytest + PowerShell)
- Stage 8: GCS Upload (cloud only)
- Stage 9: GCP Deployment (cloud only)
- Stage 10: UI Deployment (cloud only)

TESTING:
- Local deployment: All 8 stages complete in 5 minutes
- Docker images: Both API and UI built successfully
- API health checks: Passing (200 OK)
- UI health checks: Passing (200 OK)
- Multi-model support: All 4 models functional
- Test suite: 20 passed, 4 skipped, 1 non-critical error

PERFORMANCE:
- Quick profile training: 1-2 min GPU (was 3-5 min)
- Docker build: 43 sec cached (was 20+ min)
- UI image size: 1-2 GB (was 29.5 GB)
- Total deployment: 5 min (Stages 0-7)

USAGE:
Quick deployment: python deploy-master-controller.py --profile quick
Full deployment: python deploy-master-controller.py --profile full
Cloud deployment: python deploy-master-controller.py --target cloud --gcp-project PROJECT_ID
Force re-run: python deploy-master-controller.py --force --profile quick
Resume: python deploy-master-controller.py --resume
