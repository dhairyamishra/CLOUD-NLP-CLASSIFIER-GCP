# .streamlit Directory Documentation

## Overview
The `.streamlit` directory contains configuration files for the Streamlit web application component of the Cloud NLP Classifier project. Streamlit is used for the interactive web UI that allows users to test the NLP classification models.

## Directory Structure
```
.streamlit/
└── config.toml (384 bytes)
```

## Files and Their Purpose

### config.toml
This is the main configuration file for the Streamlit application, written in TOML format. It customizes the appearance, behavior, and performance of the Streamlit web interface.

## Configuration Details

### [theme] Section
Customizes the visual appearance of the Streamlit interface:

- **primaryColor**: `"#0066CC"` - Blue color used for buttons, links, and interactive elements
- **backgroundColor**: `"#FFFFFF"` - White background for the main content area
- **secondaryBackgroundColor**: `"#F0F2F6"` - Light gray background for sidebars and secondary areas
- **textColor**: `"#262730"` - Dark gray color for text content
- **font**: `"sans serif"` - Clean, modern font family for readability

### [server] Section
Configures the web server behavior:

- **port**: `8501` - The port number where the Streamlit app runs (default is 8501)
- **enableCORS**: `false` - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing disabled for security
- **enableXsrfProtection**: `true` - Cross-Site Request Forgery protection enabled
- **maxUploadSize**: `5` - Maximum file upload size in MB (likely for text file uploads)

### [browser] Section
Controls browser-related settings:

- **gatherUsageStats**: `false` - Opts out of sharing anonymous usage statistics with Streamlit

### [runner] Section
Configures the Streamlit execution engine:

- **magicEnabled**: `true` - Enables Streamlit's "magic" feature for automatic variable display
- **fastReruns**: `true` - Enables fast reruns for improved development experience

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Loading**: When Streamlit starts, it automatically detects and loads the `config.toml` file from the `.streamlit` directory
2. **Theme Application**: The theme settings are applied to all Streamlit UI components (st.title, st.button, etc.)
3. **Server Configuration**: Server settings control how the web application behaves, including security and upload limits
4. **Performance Optimization**: Runner settings enable features that improve development speed and user experience

## Integration with Project

This configuration supports the Streamlit web interface (`src/ui/app.py`) which provides:
- Interactive text classification testing
- Model selection and switching
- Real-time prediction results
- Probability visualizations
- Batch processing capabilities

## Security Considerations

- CORS is disabled for security in production deployments
- XSRF protection is enabled to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks
- Upload size is limited to 5MB to prevent abuse

## Development Notes

- The `.streamlit` directory is typically hidden (starts with dot) but is essential for proper Streamlit functioning
- Changes to `config.toml` require restarting the Streamlit app to take effect
- The theme colors are chosen to match the professional appearance expected for an NLP classification tool
